            <h2>NITI PACHHAI</h2>
            <p> Today treasure trove is presenting its next talent in the light. Niti Pachhai , the student of grade VIII believes in POSITIVITY. Today she highlights, why POSITIVITY is essential in our life. Most of the time we wonder why aren’t we getting success but she says it’s our THOUGHT which is limiting us. She states that, the most important spiritual and mental fact is WE BECOME WHAT WE ACTUALLY THINK OF MOST OF THE TIME. Success starts from the mind so how we handle our mind is very crucial. Every problem and every challenge have a way out. But rather focusing on problems it is us to know if we are sure of what we can do and what we are capable of. Niti has a wonderful perception on POSITIVITY. She says, a practice to be an OPTIMISTIC in attitude helps us to see opportunities in every challenge. Positivity is the quality of approaching challenges in life with a POSITIVE MINDSET. She shares the secret that if we want to fulfill our dreams and build determination towards it, POSITIVITY is the key. She expresses clearly, it is normal to have negativity in our mind, but ignoring them is the STRENGTH one can have in life. If not, we are going to be stuck where we are at present.  The thought in our mind “we make it or learn it” is the extreme power of a human. She urges all of us to train our mind to see good in every situation as every moment we have in our life is the best opportunity to make happen of anything we dream of.  “I am strong” “I am positive” “I can do it ““I can handle every situation perfectly” These attitudes with no bitterness in thought can always lead us towards success.

                STAY OPTIMISTIC, STAY STRONG!</p>
